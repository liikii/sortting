* Order of growth, like differentiation.

# divide-and-conquer
```
Many useful algorithms are recursive in structure: to solve a given problem, they call themselves recursively one or more times to deal with closely related sub- problems. These algorithms typically follow a divide-and-conquer approach: they break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original prob- lem but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem.
The divide-and-conquer paradigm involves three steps at each level of the recursion:
Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original prob- lem.

# merge sort
* desc: like merge two sorted array.
* complexity: 
* best condition: 
    ```python
    [1, 2, 3, 4] [5, 6, 7, 8]
    ```
* bad condition:
```python
[1, 3, 5] [0, 2, 4]
```
* merge sort 主要是解决什么问题
* 
```
